    "If we already have a function defined, it is often good to use map For example, map(sum, myLists) is more neat than [sum(x) for x in myLists]. You gain the elegance of not having to make up a dummy variable (e.g. sum(x) for x... or sum(_) for _... or sum(readableName) for readableName...) which you have to type twice, just to iterate.\n",

    "For example, to print all even numbers in range of 100, we can write [n for n in range(100) if n%2 == 0]. There is no alternate for it in map 3. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required, where as map only returns a map object and does not return any list. 4. List comprehension is faster than map when we need to evaluate expressions that are too long or complicated to express 5. Map is faster in case of calling an already defined function (as no lambda is required)\n"
